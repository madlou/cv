                Personal Statement
            </h2>
            <p>
                I consider myself to have an energetic passion for building things that are
                useful to people and have been creating Web Applications since the early
                days of the Internet. I have a relentless drive to deliver perfection, with
                an astute eye for detail.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a strong will to win and always strive to build amazing teams,
                working towards this through regular introspective reviews and continuous
                improvement methodologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although working over 25 years in Argos/Sainsbury’s, I have an extremely
                diverse career – starting off in Store Management, to being a Test Manager,
                a Product Owner, a Business Analyst, a Financial Services Operations
                Manager and for the past 8 years various Engineering Manager roles.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have vast experience in leading people; becoming a Team Lead at 18,
                Manager at 19 and a Store Manager at 23 - line managing 50+ store
                colleagues. I have continued to hone my leadership skills over the years
                and am proud of building multiple successful Engineering teams.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am known for winning hearts and minds, sharing my vision, ardent team
                engagement, detailed goal setting, being open/honest and ensuring
                colleagues feel valued.
