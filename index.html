            Personal Statement
        </h2>
        <p>
            I consider myself to have an energetic passion for building things that are
            useful to people and have been creating Web Applications since the early
            days of the Internet. I have a relentless drive to deliver perfection, with
            an astute eye for detail.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have a strong will to win and always strive to build amazing teams,
            working towards this through regular introspective reviews and continuous
            improvement methodologies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although working over 25 years in Argos/Sainsbury’s, I have an extremely
            diverse career – starting off in Store Management, to being a Test Manager,
            a Product Owner, a Business Analyst, a Financial Services Operations
            Manager and for the past 8 years various Engineering Manager roles.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have vast experience in leading people; becoming a Team Lead at 18,
            Manager at 19 and a Store Manager at 23 - line managing 50+ store
            colleagues. I have continued to hone my leadership skills over the years
            and am proud of building multiple successful Engineering teams.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am known for winning hearts and minds, sharing my vision, ardent team
            engagement, detailed goal setting, being open/honest and ensuring
            colleagues feel valued.
        </p>
